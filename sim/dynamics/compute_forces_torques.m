% Description:
% This function computes the total forces and torques acting on the vehicle.
% It considers gravity, aerodynamic drag (currently zero), and rotor forces.
% The rotor contributions are included only after deployment time and if
% the rotor is flagged as open. The rotor torque is returned as scalar (z-axis).
