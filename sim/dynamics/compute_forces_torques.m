%
% Description:
% This function computes the total forces and torques acting on the vehicle.
% It considers gravity, aerodynamic drag (currently zero), and rotor forces.
% The rotor contributions are included only after deployment time and if
% the rotor is flagged as open. The rotor torque is returned as scalar (z-axis).
%
% Inputs:
% - SIM: structure containing simulation configuration and flags
% - TIME: structure with time step size and clock management
% - VEHICLE: structure with initial state
% - ROTOR: structure with rotor state and properties
% - BLADE: structure describing the rotor blades
% - EARTH: structure with environmental constants
% - ATMOSPHERE: structure containing atmospheric properties at current altitude
%
% Outputs:
% - F_total: total force vector
% - F_rotor: force vector from rotor
% - F_gravity: gravitational force vector
% - F_drag_cilinder: aerodynamic drag force
% - T_total: total torque vector
% - T_rotor: scalar torque from rotor about z-axis
% - rotorIsOpen: flag indicating whether rotor is active at this time step
% - rotor_distribution_data: struct storing rotor distribution (azimuthal)
