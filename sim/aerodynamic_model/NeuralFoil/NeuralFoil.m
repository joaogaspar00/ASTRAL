% Description:
% This function interfaces with a Python script (NeuralAirfoil_2D.py) to 
% compute the aerodynamic coefficients (CL, CD, CM) of a given airfoil 
% based on the Reynolds number, Mach number, and angle of attack using 
% neural network-based models.
%
% The Python script is executed via the `pyrunfile` function and returns
% the aerodynamic coefficients for the specified conditions.
%
% Inputs:
% - airfoil: Name or identifier of the airfoil (e.g., 'NACA0012').
% - Re: Reynolds number (dimensionless).
% - Ma: Mach number (dimensionless).
% - alpha: Angle of attack (degrees).
%
% Outputs:
% - CL: Lift coefficient (dimensionless).
% - CD: Drag coefficient (dimensionless).
% - CM: Moment coefficient (dimensionless).
% - conf: Additional configuration or confidence metric returned from the 
%         neural network model (dimensionless).

    % Call the external Python script 'NeuralAirfoil_2D.py' to calculate
    % the aerodynamic coefficients (CL, CD, CM) for the given airfoil
    % and operating conditions (Reynolds number, Mach number, angle of attack).
    % The Python function returns a vector containing these coefficients.
