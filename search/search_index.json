With BET, it is possible to make predictions about radial and azimuthal aerodynamic load distributions over the rotor disk. Its principal is based on a quasi-2D airfoil blade section, which generates the aerodynamic forces and moments that shall be integrated over the blade length. With \\gls{bet} methodology, it is possible to perform a rotor's first designing shape stage in terms of blade geometry.</p> <p>Figure 1: BET model with a highlight blade element in red.

When considering a 2D airfoil discretisation of the blade, the radial velocity \\(U_r\\) is not taken into consideration for the 2D analysis.

Keeping the focus on the aerodynamic load, it is possible to construct the elementary aerodynamic force, \\(d\\mathbf{F}^a_n \\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\), in the aerodynamic reference frame, \\(O^a\\), as</p> \\[     d\\mathbf{F}^a_n = \\begin{bmatrix}         \\mathrm{d}D^a_n \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\mathrm{d}L^a_n     \\end{bmatrix},     \\label{eq:vector_aero_force} \\] <p>In other words, the vector presented in Eq. \\ref{eq:vector_aero_force} is the force vector of each element that shall be written in Earth-fixed coordinates for the force equation, Eq. \\ref{eq:force_equation}. For a simple implementation, the choice stands for computing the aerodynamic reference frame's\\ forces, denoted with up script \\(^a\\), and applying a cycle to compute the rotor's total force, \\(\\mathbf{F}^r_{rotor}\\), as function of all the elementary forces, \\(\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{F}^a_n\\), along the blade length and azimutal positions. Then, it is necessary to introduce the rotation matrices between the various reference frames. First from the aerodynamic to the element frame, then to the blade frame and rotor frame, and finally to the Earth-fixed frame. From the blade and to the element reference frame, there is only a translation due to the element's position, being \\(O^e\\) with the same orientation that \\(O^b\\), which means that the rotation matrix is the identity matrix, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{I}}\\). So equation \\ref{eq:aero_to_blade_force} presents the direct transformation of the elementary aerodynamic force, \\(d\\mathbf{F}^a\\), from the aerodynamic reference frame to the blade reference frame:</p> \\[     d\\mathbf{F}^b = \\boldsymbol{R}^{ot}(\\hat{y}, \\phi_n) d\\mathbf{F}^a     \\label{eq:aero_to_blade_force} \\] <p>where \\(\\boldsymbol{R}^{ot}(\\hat{y}, \\phi_n)\\) stands for the rotation matrix along \\(y\\)-axis and the inflow angle for each of the blade's elements, \\(\\phi_n\\). The rotation process is described in section \\ref{sec:rotation_matrices}. Finally, in the rotor reference frame, the elementary force, \\(d\\mathbf{F}^r\\), is given by the rotation given by the blades ' azimuthal angle, \\(\\psi_n\\), as</p> \\[     d\\mathbf{F}^r_n = \\boldsymbol{R}^{ot}(\\hat{z}, \\psi_n) d\\mathbf{F}^b \\] <p>or as a sequence of both rotations, \\(\\phi_n\\) and \\(\\psi_m\\),</p> \\[     d\\mathbf{F}^r_{m,n}= \\boldsymbol{R}^{ot}(\\hat{z}, \\psi_m) \\boldsymbol{R}^{ot}(\\hat{y}, \\phi_n) d\\mathbf{F}^a.     \\label{eq:element_force_rotor_frame} \\] <p>In terms of applied torque from the aerodynamic forces to the rotor's centre, the elementary torque applied for each element, \\(d\\mathbf{Q}^r_n\\), is given by </p> \\[     d\\mathbf{Q}^r_{m,n} = \\mathbf{r}^r_n \\times \\left[ \\boldsymbol{R}^{ot}(\\hat{z}, \\psi_m) \\boldsymbol{R}^{ot}(\\hat{y}, \\phi_n) d\\mathbf{F}^a \\right],      \\label{eq:element_torque_rotor_frame} \\] <p>where \\(\\mathbf{r}^r_n\\) stands for the position vector from the rotor's centre to the blade \\(n\\)-element. As a simplification of the next formulas, Eq.  \\ref{eq:simplication_rotation_bet} is introduced.</p> \\[     \\boldsymbol{R}^{ot}(\\hat{z}, \\psi_m) \\boldsymbol{R}^{ot}(\\hat{y}, \\phi_n) \\equiv \\underset{a \\to r}{\\boldsymbol{R}^{ot}}     \\label{eq:simplication_rotation_bet} \\] <p>and then, force expression, \\ref{eq:element_force_rotor_frame}, can be rewritten as</p> \\[     d\\mathbf{F}^r_{m,n} = \\underset{a \\to r}{\\boldsymbol{R}^{ot}} d\\mathbf{F}^a.     \\label{eq:element_force_rotor_frame_simplified} \\] <p>and for the torque, \\ref{eq:element_torque_rotor_frame}, the same expression can be used</p> <p>$$     d\\mathbf{Q}^r_{m,n} = \\mathbf{r}^r_n \\times \\left[ \\underset{a \\to r}{\\boldsymbol{R}^{ot}}  d\\mathbf{F}^a \\right] .     \\label{eq:element_torque_rotor_frame_simplified} $$.</p> <p>Knowing all the elementary forces and torques, the total force and torque applied to the rotor can be computed by integrating over the blade length between the blade's root, at a distance \\(\\epsilon\\), and the blade's tip, at a distance of \\(S_b + \\epsilon\\).

The spacecraft is considered a point-mass simulating the desired payload to recover, with a rotor coupling. Fig.\u00a01 presents a four-blade rotor coupled to the point mass. The point mass does not play any role other than is influenced by the gravity field, which will pull the vehicle to the ground and has no dimensions, only mass.

The Earth frame, \\(O^i\\), is an inertial frame positioned at any point on the Earth's surface. It is also called Navigation Frame <sup>1</sup> once it rotates with Earth, and it is very handy when planes travel from one point to another <sup>1</sup>. On the other hand, the rotor frame, \\(O^r\\), or body frame <sup>1</sup> is a system centred at any point of the symmetry plane of the aircraft. In this case, the \\(O^r\\) is the position at the CG of the vehicle, which is coincident with the point-mass position.
