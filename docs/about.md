# About

Astral is a research project dedicated to advancing the understanding of rotor dynamics and aerodynamic performance during autorotation. This project was conducted as part of the requirements for the Master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon.

The primary objective of Astral was to develop a robust and reliable model for autorotation, addressing key aerodynamic and dynamic aspects of rotor behavior. As a crucial component of this effort, a dedicated simulator was developed to provide an intuitive and efficient platform for running and controlling simulations. This tool enables systematic analysis of rotor performance under various flight conditions and facilitates the validation of theoretical models.
