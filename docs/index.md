# Welcome to ASTRAL Documentation :raised_hand:{ .wave }

Autorotation System for Targeted Recovery and Aircraft Landing (ASTRAL) is a research initiative focused on exploring rotor dynamics and aerodynamic performance under autorotation. This project was undertaken as part of the requirements for the Master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon.

The primary goal of ASTRAL is to develop a comprehensive model for autorotation, enabling better understanding and prediction of rotor behavior under various flight conditions. To support this, a dedicated simulator was created, offering a user-friendly platform to control and run simulations efficiently.

Through this documentation, you will find:

- Project Overview: Objectives, methodology, and key research questions.
- Simulator Guide: Instructions on how to run and configure simulations.
- Results and Analysis: Insights from simulations, validation of models, and aerodynamic findings.
- Resources and Links: Access to the full thesis, extended abstract, and related materials.

ASTRAL aims to provide researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts with the tools and knowledge to explore rotor dynamics in autorotation, bridging the gap between theory and practical simulation.
