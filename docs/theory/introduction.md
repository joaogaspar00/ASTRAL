# Introduction

In the previous section, the importance of the topic of this thesis was discussed. In this chapter, the background of the topic is further presented, where the problem is physically and mathematically defined, and the theory is explored. The main goal of this chapter is to provide a solid foundation for the reader to understand the problem and the proposed approach.

A key starting point is to define the body, in this case, the spacecraft model to be analysed. The spacecraft is considered a point-mass simulating the desired payload to recover, with a rotor coupling. [Fig.&nbsp;1](#fig-model1) presents a four-blade rotor coupled to the point mass. The point mass does not play any role other than is influenced by the gravity field, which will pull the vehicle to the ground and has no dimensions, only mass. In [Fig.&nbsp;1](#fig-model1), the point mass is represented as a black dot for better visual understanding.

On the other hand, the rotor is defined by the blades, which are considered to be rigid, with a blade span, $S_b$, equal for all blades. The rotor has a certain number of blades, $N_b$, 4 in the case of [Fig.&nbsp;1](#fig-model1). Also, the blades are equally distributed, with the angle between the blades, $\delta\psi$, equal for symmetry reasons.
