	abstract = {In this article, the feasibility of spacecraft recovery using rotative wings is analysed. This technology possesses the ability to perform a safe and controlled landing, allowing the spacecraft to be reused and utilised in missions with different requirements. A computational model that simulates the descent of a sounding rocket was developed. It is based on rotor’s aerodynamic theories and kinematics and computes several rotor parameters that allow the analysis of the system’s performance. The model’s validation and verification were successfully carried out by comparing its behaviour with literature data. To understand how each design parameter influences the system, a parametric study of the rotor design variables was held. It was concluded that the blade’s pitch angle is extremely important for the system’s performance and should be carefully selected, and that weight penalties resultant from excessive blade’s number or radius can be prejudicial. Furthermore, a design optimisation was conducted, aiming to minimise the rocket’s terminal velocity. Finally, a flare manoeuvre was disclosed to reduce the touchdown velocity. This recovery system is concluded to be highly promising, though requiring further work in several fields of study.},

	abstract = {Now reissued by Cambridge University Press, this sixth edition covers the fundamentals of aerodynamics using clear explanations and real-world examples. Aerodynamics concept boxes throughout showcase real-world applications, chapter objectives provide readers with a better understanding of the goal of each chapter and highlight the key 'take-home' concepts, and example problems aid understanding of how to apply core concepts. Coverage also includes the importance of aerodynamics to aircraft performance, applications of potential flow theory to aerodynamics, high-lift military airfoils, subsonic compressible transformations, and the distinguishing characteristics of hypersonic flow. Supported online by a solutions manual for instructors, MATLAB® files for example problems, and lecture slides for most chapters, this is an ideal textbook for undergraduates taking introductory courses in aerodynamics, and for graduates taking preparatory courses in aerodynamics before progressing to more advanced study.},
